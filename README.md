[![multi-builder](https://github.com/ppcamp/tauri-ui/actions/workflows/multi-builder.yml/badge.svg?branch=release)](https://github.com/ppcamp/tauri-ui/actions/workflows/multi-builder.yml)

A simple example of how to use Tauri to generate a electron application, with
WebElements

In this example, we have 2 different ways to configure
using vanilla web elements and svelte 5 preview.

In this case, to run in development mode, per example,
you need to type for vanilla
`make vanilla-run` or `make svelte-run`.
