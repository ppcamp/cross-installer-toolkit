A simple example of how to use Tauri to generate a electron application, with
WebElements

In this example, we have 2 different ways to configure
using vanilla web elements and svelte 5 preview.

In this case, to run in development mode, per example,
you need to type for vanilla
`make tauri-vanilla-run` or `make tauri-svelte-run`.


> All those svelte versions were upgraded to svelte 5 beta verison
